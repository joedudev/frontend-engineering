## 💡 What is Frontend Engineering?

Frontend engineering is the practice of building the user-facing part of web applications. Frontend engineers work closely with designers to create websites and applications that are:

- **Beautiful** - Visually appealing and engaging user interfaces
- **Functional** - Interactive features that work seamlessly
- **Fast** - Optimized performance for great user experience
- **Accessible** - Usable by everyone, regardless of abilities
- **Responsive** - Works perfectly on all devices and screen sizes

Frontend engineers are responsible for translating design mockups into living, breathing web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React.
