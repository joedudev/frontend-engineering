      If you&rsquo;re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price
      tag. But I wasn&rsquo;t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so
      I&rsquo;m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most
      important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET.
      If you&rsquo;re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you
      won&rsquo;t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and
      prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your
      tickets and get excited!

      Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don&rsquo;t you&rsquo;ll
      be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
      expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
      express through their new lines. Also it&rsquo;s important to wear shoes
      you&rsquo;ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good,
      but you&rsquo;ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
